❗ Checklist\n\n- [X] I am using the official english version of Slimefun and did not modify the jar.\n- [X] I am using an up to date \"DEV\" (not \"RC\") version of Slimefun.\n- [X] I am aware that issues related to Slimefun addons need to be reported on their bug trackers and not here.\n- [X] I searched for similar open issues and could not find an existing bug report on this.\n\n### 📍 Description\n\nHi, I was recently creating an SMP server, and I tried installing ItemsAdder, Slimefun, and an ItemsAdder addon called IAxPresenceFootsteps, which adds compatibility for the mod Presence Footsteps to ItemsAdder.\r\nhttps://github.com/Andre601/IAxPresenceFootsteps\r\nHowever, when I tested the mod, I noticed that when Slimefun was installed, it caused IAxPresenceFootsteps to load before ItemsAdder instead of after, and since ItemsAdder is a dependency of IAxPresenceFootsteps, the plugin doesn't work.\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Download the latest versions of Slimefun, ItemsAdder, and IAxPresenceFootsteps to a server.\r\n2. Start the server\r\n3. Notice that IAxPresenceFootsteps loads before ItemsAdder instead of after like it should?\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\nI expected IAxPresenceFootsteps to load after ItemsAdder like it normally does instead of before as it did here.\n\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\n\n_No response_\n\n### 📜 Server Log\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/mc7i7tZP\n\n### 📂 `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No response_\n\n### 💻 Server Software\n\nPaper\n\n### 🎮 Minecraft Version\n\n1.18.x\n\n### ⭐ Slimefun version\n\nSlimefun version DEV - 1014 (git f431aa6d)\n\n### 🧭 Other plugins\n\nItemsAdder, IAxPresenceFootsteps","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3575/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3574","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3574/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3574/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3574/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3574","id":1253322936,"node_id":"I_kwDOATMVe85KtDC4","number":3574,"title":"Crate \"key\" item from CrateReloaded duplicates Slimefun \"head\" items if mining them.","user":{"login":"mrcoffee1026","id":3322491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjI0OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3322491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcoffee1026","html_url":"https://github.com/mrcoffee1026","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcoffee1026/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcoffee1026/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcoffee1026/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcoffee1026/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcoffee1026/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcoffee1026/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcoffee1026/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcoffee1026/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcoffee1026/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"🐞 Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2629433731,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjI5NDMzNzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%8E%AF%20Needs%20testing","name":"🎯 Needs testing","color":"41CF62","default":false,"description":"This Issue needs to be tested by our team to see if it can be reproduced."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2022-05-31T04:39:10Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T07:12:52Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### ❗ Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I am using the official english version of Slimefun and did not modify the jar.\r\n- [X] I am using an up to date \"DEV\" (not \"RC\") version of Slimefun.\r\n- [X] I am aware that issues related to Slimefun addons need to be reported on their bug trackers and not here.\r\n- [X] I searched for similar open issues and could not find an existing bug report on this.\r\n\r\n### 📍 Description\r\n\r\n\"Key\" item can be used to mine Slimefun head items which will duplicate those items... will both \"break\" and leave in-tact the Slimefun head giving the user the head into inventory while leaving the original head in place (producing infinite heads if repeated).\r\n\r\nFound this technique would also work on Slimefun vanilla blocks... sometimes.  Seemed to mostly work when mining from the top face down although it doesn't always.\r\n\r\nVideo testing with CrateReloaded helper: https://vimeo.com/709927942?embedded=true&source=vimeo_logo&owner=99159429\r\n\r\nAlso created ticket with CrateReloaded:\r\nhttps://github.com/Hazebyte/CrateReloaded/issues/553\r\n\r\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nUse any crate \"key\" (ours is a tripwire hook with lore and enchants) to \"mine\" any Slimefun head item or vanilla style block and keep an eye on your inventory.\r\n\r\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nSlimefun items should either NOT break at all (possibility to blacklist key item from breaking it?) or simply not duplicate.  This appears to be directly related to file data having to do with the items: that data being unchanged since not mined with a proper \"tool\" may be resulting in the duplications.\r\n\r\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\r\n\r\nhttps://vimeo.com/709927942?embedded=true&source=vimeo_logo&owner=99159429\r\n\r\n### 📜 Server Log\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### 📂 `/error-reports/` folder\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### 💻 Server Software\r\n\r\nPaper\r\n\r\n### 🎮 Minecraft Version\r\n\r\n1.18.x\r\n\r\n### ⭐ Slimefun version\r\n\r\nMetrics-Module #25\r\nJava 17\r\n\r\nInstalled Addons: (42)\r\n  GlobalWarming vDEV -

Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nCurrently, round-robin can lead to an uneven distribution with filled chests or output nodes with filters. This is because while the index gets incremented, the actual output node is just the \"next available\" node. \r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Example</summary>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n```\r\nX - invalid output node (filled chest or filter)\r\nO - available output node\r\n\r\noutput node array:\r\nXXXXXXXXOO\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring the first 8 ticks, the round robin index would be on an X, and the next available output node would be chosen (the first O). Then the 9th tick outputs onto the first O directly, and the 10th tick outputs onto the second O. Then the round robin index rolls back over to 0 and puts 9 ticks worth of items into the first O again. In this case, the first O is heavily biased and gets much more items than the second O. This PR aims to fix that, and similar uneven distributions. \r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n<!-- Please explain what changes you have made to the code. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nWhen an item is transferred in round-robin mode, set the round-robin index to the index of the node being transferred to, so that invalid output nodes are skipped and available output nodes are distributed across the same number of sf ticks per cycle. \r\n\r\n[video demonstrating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTKyd820Ygg)\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n<!-- Please tag any Issues related to your Pull Request -->\r\n<!-- Syntax: \"Resolves #000\" -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nThis purpose of this PR is to provide a way for specific SlimefunItems to provide a summary of their contents. This would be used when Transport Slots and/or #getContents simply doesn't cut the mustard! \r\nExamples of blocks that could implement this interface would be Barrels to expose their full content as opposed to just the one stack in the output slot, Multi-page inventories to return all held items not just the currently selected one and the likes of DankPacks and likely many more possible applications I've not thought of just yet.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n<!-- Please explain what changes you have made to the code. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\n- New Interface extending ItemAttribute.\r\n- A method `getStoredItems` that will return `Map<ItemStack, Integer>` used to tell calling methods what the SlimefunItems currently contains.\r\n- A method `withdrawItem` that takes a template ItemStack and a requested amount and returns how many items were successfully removed for the calling method to then handle. (I have swapped between ItemStack, ItemStack Array and int a few times and this one felt the most useful in the end - very open to input as to the return type for this method)\r\n- A method `depositItemStacks` that takes an ItemStack array for the SlimefunItem to try to consume into the storage. Currently returns nothing as the calling method can just look at the array after calling to check what's left - open to having the return the modified array instead?)\r\n- A method `depositItemStack` that just calls `depositItemStacks`. Return type may change based on feedback to the above.\r\n- A method `contains` to return a boolean if the SlimefunItem contains a matching ItemStack within itself.\r\n\r\nSee Sefiraat/Networks@3e36b9f in which I changed my Network Shells (v e r y r o u g h l y) to use this interface and had the network read the items in a much neater way than I was doing previously.

Description\r\nThis PR is twofold: on one hand, it transforms all the damage dealt by lightnings to damage dealt by the caster; on the other, it adds the ability to enable StormStaff usage in non PVP areas (as any damage is now automatically nullified, having the EntityDamageByEntityEvent been \"transformed\" to attribute the damage to the caster).\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n- Substituted any EntityDamageByEntityEvent caused by StormStaff lightnings with ones with the caster as damager\r\n- Added an ItemSetting to allow enabling usage of Storm Staves in non PVP area (damage to players is prevented)\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n#3396\r\n#3408 \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created

Description\r\nCurrently there is an issue with the Book Binder.\r\nIf you combine 2 books of the same level and the resulting level will go above the set limit (either vanilla or custom) the books will combine into one and keep their current level.\r\n\r\nThis fix makes it so that if a `Fortune III` gets combined with another `Fortune III`, it will not be combined into another `Fortune III` (granted there is no custom limit)\r\nThis has no effect for books with multiple enchantments as both books have the same level\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n- Fix books being consumed and returning their current value\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are

Install Slimefun\r\n2. Disable Stone Chunks from `items.yml`\r\n3. Look at the guide, the recipe just got shifted\r\n4. Try using the compressor just using 1 coal\r\n5. It will output 8 coal\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\nThe recipe should not be shifted.\n\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\n\nhttps://youtu.be/sgOPYilkLis\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Side by

The main problem I need to fix, is actually fact that players are able to enchant mmoitems witch blocked use in enchanting tables or anvils in sf autoenchanters. in. My items are blocked against enchanting but in sf you can simply bypass it. I know there's a way to add blocked lore. But what about old items without that lore? A lot of of my players using items without this lore.\r\n\r\nSo what I need to add ?\r\nEasily check stats from mmoitem and if it has blocked using in crafting, enchanting.., it won't be possible to upgrade this item. This will be probably better than using lores, because it will apply to all items no matter how old those items are.\r\n\r\nLet me know, if it is possible, thanks and have a good day!\r\n\r\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nCreate an mmoitem and block it's interaction in enchanting tables/anvils.\r\nAdd this item to slimefun autoenchanter.\r\nYou can add this item there.\r\n\r\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nMMOItems with blocked features like using them in enchanting tables, they should not be usable in sf as well.\r\n\r\n### 📷 Screenshots /

📔 Introduction\r\nOver the last few months and years you all have often requested for us to be more open in regards to upcoming changes.\r\nSo we decided its time to finally release a proper roadmap.\r\nNote here that this roadmap will never be complete and final, we may add or change some goals from time to time and we will refrain from setting a release date for things until absolutely certain.\r\n\r\nThis simply serves as a rough guide for you to see what changes you can be excited about.\r\nMany of those changes will likely be of technical nature though, so they may not be as exciting or intesting at first.\r\n\r\nAlso, we aren't actively looking for pull requests towards these goals unless explicitly requested.\r\nIf you wish to make a pull request, choose any open issue or approved suggestion and you are more than welcome :heart:\r\nThese changes however are mainly targeted towards the core team.\r\n\r\n## ⭐ Upcoming changes\r\nSome of these milestones will have a

You can read more about this here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3139\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (Q1 2022) Inventory system rewrite\r\nNext up is a rewrite for our inventory-system. The API is very rusty and aged. We don't have an ETA yet, perhaps closely after or along with the aforementioned API relocation.\r\nThe new system will be much more flexible and easier to use for developers.\r\n\r\n### 🎈(Q1 2022) New sound-system\r\nSoon we will allow server owners to fully configure any sound in this plugin.\r\nThis will also work with custom sounds from resource packs. Additionally you can change the pitch and volume of any sound or even mute it.\r\nYou can see the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2844\r\n\r\n### 🎈 (Q1 2022) Changes to the radiation system\r\nThanks to @Semisol you will soon be able to enjoy a new radiation system which works by calculating a so-called \"exposure level\" to a radioactive substance. You won't experience radiation symptoms until a certain exposure level has been reached.\r\nThis will also make the different radiation levels much more distinct from each other and the features comes with a few good-looking UI changes too! You can track the progress of that here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3189\r\n\r\n### 🎈 (Q2 2022) SQL database support and Research system rewrite\r\nThe Research system will be rewritten api-wise.\r\nWe will also drop numeric ids for researches and solely rely on namespaced keys.\r\nIn addition to this, we will add support for SQL databases to sync researches across multiple servers.\r\nAlternatively, a local file-based database can be used.\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (Q2 2022) Recipe system rewrite\r\nOur recipe system is in deep need of a rewrite, it needs to be much less item-comparison based and we should allow alternate ingredients through the use of material tags or slimefun item classes and such.\r\nI will be doing this rewrite myself and some infrastructure has been set up already but nothing to show you yet, it is still a while until we get there.\r\n\r\n### 🎈 (Q3 2022) Programmable androids rewrite\r\nProgrammable androids are great.\r\nBut they can be better! We will be stripping the data of an android from its block and give it a unique identity instead.\r\nThe UI will be completely redone and it will have much better performance. Oh, and you will be able to give other players access to your android and configure their permissions.\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (2022) Updating to Java 16\r\nSlimefun will *eventually* update to Java 16 in the future.\r\nWe will give a proper announcement on when this will happen though.\r\nThere isn't any rush as we will wait until a large majority of servers have already upgraded.\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (TBD) Ticker rewrite\r\nThanks to @LinoxGH and @md5sha256 our ticker system will be rewritten to be much more reliable.\r\nThis will also include some API changes that are yet to be added, you can track the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2996\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (TBD) BlockStorage system rewrite\r\nThe \"block-storage\" system will be rewritten, the API will change drastically and we will open it up for much more efficient storage methods, this will do a lot in regards to stability and performance in the long-run.\r\nYou can track the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2792\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (TBD) Changes to the config system and perhaps a reload command\r\nWe haven't fully decided on this one yet but you can follow the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2822\r\n\r\n### 💡 (TBD) Cargo networks rewrite\r\nWhere do we even start here... It needs a rewrite, nuff said.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🎉 Feedback\r\nWe are always looking for feedback!\r\nIf you have something to suggest, check out our discord server @ https://discord.gg/slimefun and visit `#suggestions`.\r\nWe are always eager to see what the community wants or doesn't want.\r\nIf you are a developer and have questions or concerns regarding some of the more technical changes, simply post your question in `#programming-help` and we will get back to you!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3170/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3147","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3147/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3147/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3147/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3147","id":936663462,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MzY2NjM0NjI=","number":3147,"title":"Items on Ancient Pedestal can be moved with falling block","user":{"login":"Ltfjx","id":69747100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzQ3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69747100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx","html_url":"https://github.com/Ltfjx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ltfjx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"🐞 Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2642156940,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjQyMTU2OTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%A7%A8%20Confirmed%20Bug","name":"🧨 Confirmed Bug","color":"B3EFFA","default":false,"description":"This bug has been confirmed by our team."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2021-07-05T04:10:45Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T18:21:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### ❗ Checklist\n\n- [X] I am using the official english version of Slimefun and did not modify the jar.\n- [X] I am using an up to date \"DEV\" (not \"RC\") version of Slimefun.\n- [X] I am aware that issues related to Slimefun addons need to be reported on their bug trackers and not here.\n- [x] I searched for similar open issues and could not find an existing bug report on this.\n\n### 📍 Description\n\nGravity blocks like snad can not be place upon the Ancient Pedestal.

I was wondering if there is a way to unload the various slimefun blocks, instead of just saving them, as happens now.\r\n\r\nOr a help where you simply tell me mainly the classes that I should touch/look at in order to understand how to fix the problem... for now I have tried to fix the networks, I actually managed to do it, at least that's what I hoped for... but the problem persists...\r\n\r\n\r\n(I solved the problem of networks by unloading them when the world is unloaded (onWorldUnload event), using the method provided)\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\nto reproduce this problem you need 1 plugin that allows you to Unloose and load worlds (like SlimeWorld or MultiverseCore)\r\n\r\n1) at startup place slimefun blocks in a new world (not the main one!), create 1 network (cargo or Energy) and the furnaces that generate electricity (i.e. the head)\r\n\r\n2) Unload the world with /mv unload worldName or /swm unload worldName (make sure there is nobody in this world when you do these commands!)\r\n\r\n3) Wait a few minutes and reload the world with /mv load worldName or /swm load worldName.\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\ndepends on what you place, I found errors in the console (in the case of the furnaces that generate electricity, due to lack of network) or simply the various blocks stop working properly (since are duplicated, or unusable due to the existence of a duplicate router)\n\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\n\n_No response_\n\n### 📜 Server Log\n\n_No response_\n\n### 📂 `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No response_\n\n### 💻 Server Software\n\nYatopia\n\n### 🎮 Minecraft Version\n\n1.16.x\n\n### ⭐ Slimefun version\n\nI use a recoding of the v4.9 \n\n### 🧭 Other plugins\n\nAdvancedSlimeWorldManager","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3090/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076","id":899857016,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4OTk4NTcwMTY=","number":3076,"title":"Slimefun and PyroMining incompatibility ","user":{"login":"ItsSynchro","id":16171807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTcxODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16171807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro","html_url":"https://github.com/ItsSynchro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"🐞 Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2629433731,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjI5NDMzNzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%8E%AF%20Needs%20testing","name":"🎯 Needs testing","color":"41CF62","default":false,"description":"This Issue needs to be tested by our team to see if it can be reproduced."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2021-05-24T17:24:36Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T18:21:46Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"<!-- FILL IN THE FORM BELOW -->\r\n\r\n## :round_pushpin: Description (REQUIRED)\r\n<!-- A clear and detailed description of what went wrong. -->\r\n<!-- The more information you can provide, the easier we can handle this problem. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\nUpon using PyroMining and Slimefun, individuals are able to obtain PyroMining items if they break ores with a pickaxe that they don't have researched.

Description\r\n<!-- Please explain what you changed/added and why you did it in detail. -->\r\nThis pull request adds the `SoundService` and the `SoundEffect` enum which allow us to easily play sounds\r\nbut also allow server owners to easily configure and customize sounds.\r\nNote here that I opted for the minecraft-ids of sounds rather than the bukkit constants because this will allow\r\nserver owners to use completely custom sounds in combination with resource packs.\r\nIf a sound does not exist, the player will simply not hear anything, no error will be thrown.\r\n\r\nWhen values are misconfigured, a helpful warning will appear in the console.\r\nThis will also protect us against Mojang sound changes in the future, as we don't have to worry about the support of changed enum constants or such.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the new config file:\r\n```yaml\r\nPORTABLE_CRAFTER_OPEN_SOUND:\r\n  sound: entity.wolf.howl\r\n  volume: 1.0\r\n  pitch: 0.123456789\r\nSPLINT_CONSUME_SOUND:\r\n  sound: entity.skeleton.hurt\r\n  volume: 1.0\r\n  pitch: 1.0\r\nTRASH_CAN_OPEN_SOUND:\r\n  sound: i.dont.exist.btw.spinach.sucks.and.pineapple.on.pizza.rules\r\n  volume: 1.0\r\n  pitch: 1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ToDo (Why this is still a draft)\r\n* [x] MockBukkit does not support String-sounds atm, so Unit Tests will fail, I will need to update MockBukkit for that first\r\n* [ ] I would like to add Unit Tests for this sound service too\r\n* [ ] Not all sounds have been converted yet\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you should follow. -->\r\n<!-- You can click those check boxes after you posted your issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have fully tested the proposed changes and promise that they will not break everything into chaos.\r\n- [x] I have also tested the proposed changes in combination with various popular addons and can confirm my changes do not break them.\r\n- [x] I followed the existing code standards and didn't mess up the formatting.\r\n- [x] I did my best to add documentation to any public classes or methods I added.\r\n- [x] I have added `Nonnull` and `Nullable` annotations to my methods to indicate their behaviour for null values\r\n- [ ] I added sufficient Unit Tests to cover my code.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2844/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835","id":814068423,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4MTQwNjg0MjM=","number":2835,"title":"Default

Observe how items are transferred into the destroyed Electric Furnace and are destroyed immediately afterwards as the TickerTask processes the removal of the Electric Furnace \r\n\r\nFrom my testing this is a very rare occasion, and as such a very hard bug to reproduce.\r\nHowever, with the help of a debugger which is capable of pausing the async TickerTask, it is reproducible every time\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nThe item does not transfer, or drops in the world\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n - Minecraft Version: v1_15_R1\r\n - Slimefun Version: DEV 489 (git d8964)\r\n - CS-CoreLib Version: v1.6.3\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/1819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/1819/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121","id":204901222,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMDQ5MDEyMjI=","number":121,"title":"Cargo Input Nodes don't transfer whitelisted Items if not-whitelisted items come first","user":{"login":"BlackBeltPanda","id":5866087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjYwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5866087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda","html_url":"https://github.com/BlackBeltPanda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"🐞 Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2642156940,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjQyMTU2OTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%A7%A8%20Confirmed%20Bug","name":"🧨 Confirmed Bug","color":"B3EFFA","default":false,"description":"This bug has been confirmed by our team."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2017-02-02T15:12:02Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T02:49:40Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## Description\r\nWith an Input Node in Blacklist mode and no items blacklisted, connected to a chest with an Advanced Output Node with an item whitelisted, if any items are blocking the slots before the whitelisted item in the input chest with nowhere to go, the whitelisted item never gets transported.\r\n\r\n## Evidence / Proof\r\nGIF: https://i.gyazo.com/7199e6c7f7e7f173fa3c7f1dfa778efc.gif\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nMC version: 1.11.2 (git-Paper-1032)\r\nCS-CoreLib version: 1.5.12\r\nSlimefun version: 4.1.1\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}]
